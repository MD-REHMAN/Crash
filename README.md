Everyone dreams to make their own game and so do I. So to make my dream a reality I made this game when I started learning Andriod. And now I'm making it open source for anyone who want to learn. Using the above link you can download the game on your android device and play yourself.

I have only uploaded the raw code. So simple copy paste won't do the trick. To run it on your Android Studio you need to have first hand knowledge of Android.
